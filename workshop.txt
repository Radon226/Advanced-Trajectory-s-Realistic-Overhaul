title=Advanced Trajectory's Realistic Overhaul
description=[b]This is a complete and realistic overhaul of a mod called Advanced Trajectory. It tries to involve as much player skill as possible while having PZ's RPG mechanics such as moodles play a big role during gunplay. This is suited for players who want a more hardcore experience.

description=If you like the mod, don't forget to give it a like! Enjoy![/b]

description=[h1]Updated 10/15/23: Check change notes below thumbnail to see previous changes made before.[/h1]
description=[h3]Hotfix 10/16/23: Fixed line 1684 error and provided sandbox option to mess with max cone spread.[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] XP modifiers actually work now
description=[*] Zombie collision code has been tweaked so players can't damage zombies behind them when shooting in the opposite direction. It may still happen but it's more unlikely that previously. I still need to put some work into it.
description=[*] Arrows and bolts appear in zombie's inventory now (credits to Lisola)
description=[*] Tweaked with projectile logic. I narrowed the cone a bit so the bullet no longer goes 90 degree off to the side. Bullets spawn closer to the character to make point blanks a lot easier.
description=[*] Attachment system is overhauled. It tries to give a good balance between vanilla and B

description=[h1]Changes from Advanced Trajectory. Watch the video for a better explanation of these changes.[/h1]
description=
description=[h3]Gunplay (keyword is bloom)[/h3]
description=At levels 3 to 10, the gunplay works similarly to Resident Evil 2 Remake meaning the player has to wait a bit for the character to "focus" and aim for their target before hitting an accurate shot. For example, a player is aiming and standing still leading the bloom value to go from 100 to 30. Once the bloom reaches 30, it waits for a second or two before reducing to 0. A value below 5 (crosshair changes color) is what you want as it allows you to deal the most damage when aiming for the head, otherwise, it will be treated as body damage. So don't waste your ammo spraying bullets because you'll either miss or do little damage. Let's call this whole thing the "focus mechanic" for the sake of naming.
description=
description=[h3]Higher level = higher accuracy and crit chance[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] levels 0 to 2: very bad at shooting with anything but shotguns; player is limited to only dealing body and foot damage, but is not limited to dealing crit damage
description=[*] level 3: focus mechanic is unlocked which allows the player to get an accurate shot on a target from afar (can hit headshots)
description=[*] level 5: focus timer starts to scale with player level, game becomes easier due to a big power spike
description=[*] level 8: focus timer is ignored meaning players can quickly hit headshots with ease
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]Moodles[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Has a Cold[/b]: sneezing adds a big burst of bloom whereas coughing adds a little
description=[*] [b]Drunk[/b]: more bloom is added when moving and turning
description=[*] [b]Endurance[/b]: aim sways
description=[*] [b]Hyperthermia[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[*] [b]Hypothermia[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[*] [b]Pain[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[*] [b]Panic[/b]: crosshair becomes invisible after a certain bloom value
description=[*] [b]Stress[/b]: limits the value of how small bloom can reduce to, has a shaky visual effect that is toned down the higher the level
description=[*] [b]Fatigue/Sleepiness[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]Weapon Attachments[/h3]
description=If you deck out your weapon, you will have a much easier time shooting. It can even nullify negative effects at a certain level.
description=[list]
description=[*] AimingTime(+) => Increases bloom reduction
description=[*] HitChance(+)   => Shortens focus timer
description=[*] Recoil(-)           => Reduces recoil
description=[*] Range(+)          => Increases range
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]True Crouch and True Crawl Support[/h3]
description=Not required, but a necessity for a full and funner experience.
description=[list]
description=[h3]Crouch[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] When performed, bloom is reduced for levels that have not unlocked the focus mechanic
description=[*] Bloom reduction rate is increased for all levels, helps a lot when exhausted
description=[*] Can burst a few bullets while ignoring the focus timer depending on the level and recoil
description=[*] Is OP when your gun is decked with attachments
description=[/list]
description=[h3]Crawl/Prone[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] you get effects from crouch but better and faster time to focus (less time waiting at minaimnum)
description=[*] recoil reduced by half
description=[/list]
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]Other Changes[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] The issue with bullets going through walls and buildings is much less of an issue now. It can happen, just a lot less so don't waste your ammo trying to kill them through solid walls.
description=[*] Changed crosshair texture (classic 4 rectangles)
description=[*] Crit chance for all weapons but shotguns is dependent on weapon's crit stat, bloom, and player level. Shotguns ignore bloom when it comes to determining crit chance.
description=[*] Crosshair fades in rather than suddenly appear when beginning to aim, synergizes very well with the panic effects
description=[*] Recoil now depends on weapon's damage stat instead of aiming time
description=[*] Reloading and racking your gun hides and the crosshair and adds a bit of bloom
description=[*] Gun's recoil delay state affects how long the focus timer is
description=[*] Nearly everything can be customized in the sandbox options with descriptions; ex. can change color of crosshair when bloom is 0

description=[h1]FAQ[/h1]
description=[b]Does this work with multiplayer?[/b]
description=Yes. The multiplayer code was left untouched.

description=Yes.
description=
description=[b]Can I remove this mod from existing saves?[/b]
description=Yes.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with other weapon mods?[/b]
description=Yes. I have tested Brita's Weapon Pack with Arsenal[26], VFE (Vanilla's Firearm Expansion), and Firearms B41. If this mod works with these packs, then it should work with every weapon pack,
description=
description=[b]Do Brita's attachments work?[/b]
description=Yes, they do.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with Superb Survivors or any NPC mod?[/b]
description=No. I don't plan on fixing issues that may occur with it.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with Bow and Arrows?[/b]
description=Yes.
description=
description=[b]Do I really need True Crouch and True Crawl?[/b]
description=No, but is recommended for a better experience.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with Snake's modpack?[/b]
description=Yes. However, a user has stated that there's a small bug where suppressed weapons don't play the correct firing sound every time the save is launched. A quick fix atm is to reattach the suppressor.
description=
description=[b]I'm level 3/4 and it takes too long for the bloom to get to 0, how do I make it faster?[/b]
description=You can go to the sandbox options and set the value of "Focus Counter Speed" to 3 or 4 (default is 2).
description=
description=[b]I'm level 0/1/2 and my accuracy is awful, how do I make it better?[/b]
description=That's intentional but you can make early game with guns slightly better by going to the sandbox options and setting the value of "Minaimnum modifier" to a lower value like 4.
description=
description=[b]How do I get rid of the crosshair's low framerate?[/b]
description=Uncheck "UI Offscreen Rendering" in your settings for smooth crosshair movement.
