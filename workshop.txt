title=Advanced Trajectory's Realistic Overhaul
description=[b]This is a complete and realistic overhaul of a mod called Advanced Trajectory. It tries to involve as much player skill as possible while having PZ's RPG mechanics such as moodles play a big role during gunplay. This is suited for players who want a more hardcore experience.

description=
description=[h3]Gunplay (keyword is bloom)[/h3]
description=At levels 3 to 10, the gunplay works similarly to Resident Evil 2 Remake meaning the player has to wait a bit for the character to "focus" and aim for their target before hitting an accurate shot. For example, a player is aiming and standing still leading the bloom value to go from 100 to 30. Once the bloom reaches 30, it waits for a second or two before reducing to 0. A value below 5 (crosshair changes color) is what you want as it allows you to deal the most damage when aiming for the head, otherwise, it will be treated as body damage. So don't waste your ammo spraying bullets because you'll either miss or do little damage. Let's call this whole thing the "focus mechanic" for the sake of naming.
description=
description=[h3]Higher level = higher accuracy and crit chance, less chance of missing[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] levels 0 to 2: very bad at shooting with anything but shotguns; player is limited to only dealing body and foot damage, but is not limited to dealing crit damage
description=[*] level 3: focus mechanic is unlocked which allows the player to get an accurate shot on a target from afar (can hit headshots)
description=[*] level 6+: bloom reduction rate is capped and no longer scales, however the crosshair will continue to get smaller the higher level you are
description=[*] level 10: player can run n gun and is a headshot machine (if stationary)
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]Hit/Miss (Can be disabled)[/h3]
description=When the crosshair is slightly transparent at a certain bloom (which is dependent on aiming level), RNG will begin to play a role in determining whether or not the individual projectile will hit their target. Shotguns give a significant buff in increasing the bloom in which the RNG will be in effect.
description=
description=[h3]Distance Penalty (Can be disabled)[/h3]
description=Crosshair will get bigger after a certain distance. The penalty is less severe the higher the aiming level and the longer the weapon range.
description=
description=[h3]Moodles[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Has a Cold[/b]: sneezing adds a big burst of bloom whereas coughing adds a little
description=[*] [b]Drunk[/b]: more bloom is added when moving and turning
description=[*] [b]Endurance[/b]: aim sways a lot
description=[*] [b]Hyperthermia/Hypothermia[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[*] [b]Fatigue[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction drastically
description=[*] [b]Stress[/b]: limits the value of how small bloom can reduce to and makes crosshair shaky
description=[*] [b]Pain[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction, adds shaky visual effect to crosshair, and limits how small bloom can reduce to
description=[*] [b]Panic[/b]: increases effect of distance penalty and makes crosshair shaky
description=[*] [b]Heavy[/b]: Similar to drunkness, penalty when moving and turning is amplified. In addition, stamina consumption when switching stances is increased and more bloom will be added when switching between crouch and stand stance.

description=[h3]Weapon Attachments[/h3]
description=If you deck out your weapon, you will have a much easier time shooting. It can even nullify negative effects at a certain level.
description=[list]
description=[*] AimingTime(+) => Increases bloom reduction
description=[*] HitChance(+)   => Shortens focus timer
description=[*] Recoil(-)           => Reduces recoil
description=[*] Range(+)          => Increases range
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]True Crouch and True Crawl Support[/h3]
description=Not required, but a necessity for a full and funner experience.
description=[list]
description=[*] Switching stances will consume stamina based on fitness level and heavy moodle level. Switching stances between crouch and stand adds bloom while aiming.
description=[h3]Crouch[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] When performed, bloom is reduced for levels that have not unlocked the focus mechanic
description=[*] Bloom reduction rate is increased for all levels, helps a lot when exhausted
description=[*] Can burst a few bullets while ignoring the focus timer depending on the level and recoil
description=[*] Is OP when your gun is decked with attachments
description=[/list]
description=[h3]Crawl/Prone[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] you get effects from crouch but better and faster time to focus (less time waiting at minaimnum)
description=[*] recoil reduced by half

description=To set it up, you'll need the "Mod Options" mod to make changes to the Alt. Crosshair. Go to your settings and locate Mod Options -> Alt. Crosshair, then set Ranged Weapon Crosshair to "IsoCursorFade" or "IsoCursorOpaque". After that, turn down the transparency of the vanilla isometric cursor in the main settings tab.
