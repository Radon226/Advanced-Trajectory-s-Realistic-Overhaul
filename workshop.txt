title=Advanced Trajectory's Realistic Overhaul
description=[b]This is a complete and realistic overhaul of a mod called Advanced Trajectory. It tries to involve as much player skill as possible while having PZ's RPG mechanics such as moodles play a big role during gunplay. This is suited for players who want a more hardcore experience.

description=[h1]Changes from Advanced Trajectory. Watch the video for a better explanation of these changes.[/h1]
description=
description=[h3]Gunplay (keyword is bloom)[/h3]
description=At levels 3 to 10, the gunplay works similarly to Resident Evil 2 Remake meaning the player has to wait a bit for the character to "focus" and aim for their target before hitting an accurate shot. For example, a player is aiming and standing still leading the bloom value to go from 100 to 30. Once the bloom reaches 30, it waits for a second or two before reducing to 0. A value below 5 (crosshair changes color) is what you want as it allows you to deal the most damage when aiming for the head, otherwise, it will be treated as body damage. So don't waste your ammo spraying bullets because you'll either miss or do little damage. Let's call this whole thing the "focus mechanic" for the sake of naming.
description=
description=[h3]Higher level = higher accuracy and crit chance[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] levels 0 to 2: very bad at shooting with anything but shotguns; player is limited to only dealing body and foot damage, but is not limited to dealing crit damage
description=[*] level 3: focus mechanic is unlocked which allows the player to get an accurate shot on a target from afar (can hit headshots)
description=[*] level 6+: bloom reduction rate is capped and no longer scales, however the crosshair will continue to get smaller the higher level you are
description=[*] level 10: player becomes a headshot machine
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]Moodles[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Has a Cold[/b]: sneezing adds a big burst of bloom whereas coughing adds a little
description=[*] [b]Drunk[/b]: more bloom is added when moving and turning
description=[*] [b]Endurance[/b]: aim sways a lot
description=[*] [b]Hyperthermia[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[*] [b]Hypothermia[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction
description=[*] [b]Fatigue[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction drastically
description=[*] [b]Stress[/b]: limits the value of how small bloom can reduce to and adds shaky visual effect to crosshair
description=[*] [b]Pain[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction, adds shaky visual effect to crosshair, and limits how small bloom can reduce to
description=[*] [b]Panic[/b]: crosshair becomes invisible after a certain bloom value
description=[*] [b]Heavy[/b]: Similar to drunkness, penalty when moving and turning is amplified. In addition, stamina consumption when switching stances is increased and more bloom will be added when switching between crouch and stand stance.

description=
description=[h3]Weapon Attachments[/h3]
description=If you deck out your weapon, you will have a much easier time shooting. It can even nullify negative effects at a certain level.
description=[list]
description=[*] AimingTime(+) => Increases bloom reduction
description=[*] HitChance(+)   => Shortens focus timer
description=[*] Recoil(-)           => Reduces recoil
description=[*] Range(+)          => Increases range
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]True Crouch and True Crawl Support[/h3]
description=Not required, but a necessity for a full and funner experience.
description=[list]
description=[*] Switching stances will consume stamina based on fitness level and heavy moodle level. Switching stances between crouch and stand adds bloom while aiming.
description=[h3]Crouch[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] When performed, bloom is reduced for levels that have not unlocked the focus mechanic
description=[*] Bloom reduction rate is increased for all levels, helps a lot when exhausted
description=[*] Can burst a few bullets while ignoring the focus timer depending on the level and recoil
description=[*] Is OP when your gun is decked with attachments
description=[/list]
description=[h3]Crawl/Prone[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] you get effects from crouch but better and faster time to focus (less time waiting at minaimnum)
description=[*] recoil reduced by half
description=[/list]
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h3]Other Changes from og AT[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*] Wall collision is fixed
description=[*] Changed crosshair texture (classic 4 rectangles)
description=[*] Crit chance for all weapons but shotguns is dependent on weapon's crit stat, bloom, and player level. Shotguns ignore bloom when it comes to determining crit chance.
description=[*] Crosshair fades in rather than suddenly appear when beginning to aim, synergizes very well with the panic effects
description=[*] Recoil now depends on weapon's damage stat instead of aiming time
description=[*] Reloading and racking your gun hides and the crosshair and adds a bit of bloom
description=[*] Gun's recoil delay state affects how long the focus timer is
description=[*] Nearly everything can be customized in the sandbox options with descriptions; ex. can change color of crosshair when bloom is 0
description=[*] Many others when looking at the change notes

description=[h1]FAQ[/h1]
description=[b]Does this work with multiplayer?[/b]
description=Yes. 
description=
description=[b]Do I need to install the original Advanced Trajectory mod?[/b]
description=No, this mod is all you need.

description=Yes.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with splitscreen or controller?[/b]
description=No, it currently does not.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with other weapon mods?[/b]
description=Yes. I have tested Brita's Weapon Pack with Arsenal[26], VFE (Vanilla's Firearm Expansion), and Firearms B41. If this mod works with these packs, then it should work with every weapon pack,
description=
description=[b]Do Brita's attachments work?[/b]
description=Yes, they do.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with Superb Survivors or any NPC mod?[/b]
description=Yes, just make sure to enable "Ignore PVP Safety" in sandbox options so you can damage NPCs with guns.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with Bow and Arrows?[/b]
description=Yes.
description=
description=[b]Do I really need True Crouch and True Crawl?[/b]
description=No, but it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a better experience. You will suffer without these mods.
description=
description=[b]Does this work with Snake's modpack?[/b]
description=Yes. However, a user has stated that there's a small bug where suppressed weapons don't play the correct firing sound every time the save is launched. A quick fix atm is to reattach the suppressor.
description=
description=[b]I'm level 3/4 and it takes too long for the bloom to get to 0, how do I make it faster?[/b]
description=You can go to the sandbox options and set the value of "Focus Counter Speed" to 3 or 4 (default is 2).
description=
description=[b]I'm level 0/1/2 and my accuracy is awful, how do I make it better?[/b]
description=That's intentional but you can make early game with guns slightly better by going to the sandbox options and setting the value of "Minaimnum modifier" to a lower value like 4. Or you can set the max cone spread to a lower value.
description=
description=[b]How do I get rid of the crosshair's low framerate?[/b]
description=Uncheck "UI Offscreen Rendering" in your settings for smooth crosshair movement.
